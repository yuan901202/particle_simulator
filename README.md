# Particle Simulator
[NWEN303] Implement the particle simulator with parallelism technology in Java

We use parallelism in order to improve the efficiency of a given Particle simulator wrote in Java.

## Tasks

### Task 1
The class “Model.java” is in charge of managing all of the logic of the particle simulator.

### Task 2
Gui.java already have a minimal form of parallelism.

### Task 3~6
For the following task please create a new file and name it “ModelParallel.java”.

This class “(ModelParallel”) should behave exactly the same as Model.java, but should use
multiple threads for better performance.
